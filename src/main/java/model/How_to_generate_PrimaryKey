1. GenerationType.IDENTITY

   - Easy to implements but not best for performance..
   - It relies on an auto-incremented database column and lets the database
       generate a new value with each insert operation. From a database point of view,
       this is very efficient because the auto-increment columns are highly optimized,
       and it doesnâ€™t require any additional statements.

2. GenerationType.AUTO

    - When you don't provide any specific method, it will automatic use auto.
    - This will follow Id generation base on your database provider

3. GenerationType.SEQUENCE

    - It requires additional select statements to get the next value from a database sequence.
    But this has no performance impact on most applications.
    And if your application has to persist a huge number of new entities,
    you can use some Hibernate specific optimizations to reduce the number of statements.

4. GenerationType.TABLE

   - No longer recommended to use.
