Hibernate 5 - Read an Entity
In Hibernate, an entity can be obtained from a database
using the following Session methods –

Session.get() → This method returns a persistence object of the given
class with the given identifier. It will return null if there is no persistence object.

Session.load() → This method returns a persistence object of the
given class with the given identifier. It will throw an exception
ObjectNotFoundException if an entity does not exist in the database.
The load() method may return a proxy object instead of a real persistence object.

Session.byId() → This method is used to obtain a persistence
object by it a primary identifier.
